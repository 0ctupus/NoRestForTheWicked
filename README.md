# No Rest For The Wicked 

For those who want to test out different Builds and lack specific Gear t here is hope.

A Realm with Good;es and Loot that is utilized by the featured Characters is distributed across the 4 Houses in Sacrament.

The Realm_XXXXX...XXX.dat belongs into your c:|Users|<youruser>|AppData|LocalLow|Moon Studios|NoRestForTheWicked|Datastore

Open the .dat File with your favorite Texteditor (e.g. Textedit.exe) and replace the String XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with your Account ID.

Should do the tricky. I recommend to test this offline first, not sure how this steam cloud sync stuff works.
